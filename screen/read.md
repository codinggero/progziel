Task Description
Assignment Details:
Task: Create a Full Stack Application with the following functionality:
Authentication: Implement user registration and login functionality. Ensure that authenticated users have access to specific endpoints.
Post Management: Develop API endpoints for creating, viewing, and updating posts in real-time.
User Profile: Build a user profile page that displays user information and allows users to update their profiles.
Front-End Integration: Integrate the APIs you create into a Flutter front-end application that interacts with these endpoints.
Authentication and Authorization: Ensure that the APIs have authentication functionality. Users should not be able to access posts or profiles without being authenticated. Logout functionality should also be implemented.
Documentation: Provide thorough documentation for your code, including API endpoints, how to run the application, and any important technical decisions.
Submission Requirements:
Upon completing the task, we request the following submissions:
Code: Share the codebase for both the back-end and front-end.
Documentation: Include comprehensive documentation on how to run the application and APIs.
APK: Provide the APK for the Flutter front-end application.
Postman Collection: Share a Postman collection containing the API endpoints for testing.
